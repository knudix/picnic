	<h1>FAQ:</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Q: Why does the app show the same country for both sides of the converter?</li>
		<li>A: The app uses your location as well as phones region. The region can be changed under Settings>General>Language and Region</li>
		<li>Q: I want to select another country than the ones proposed!</li><li>A: It is possible to override countries by adding country-identifiers under System Preferences > Picnic. These must be of the format xx_XX i.e: en_US. Better integration for overriding will come in a future release.</li>
